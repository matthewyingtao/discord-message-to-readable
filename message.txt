Sweet
But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like "wait"
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days

Your dad left because Ronald Mcdonald needed help with a verse that would singularly put Burger king out of business
